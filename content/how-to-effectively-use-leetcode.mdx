## Introduction to LeetCode

LeetCode is a popular platform for practicing coding problems, often used to prepare for technical interviews
at large tech companies. It has a large collection of problems, ranging from easy to hard, and supports a variety of
programming languages. It also has a built-in IDE that allows you to run your code against test cases. This guide will
cover how to use LeetCode effectively to prepare for technical interviews.

## Getting Started

If you have good understanding of data structures and algorithms, you'll have an easier time solving LeetCode problems.
In my opinion it's not 100% required before jumping into problems. Yes, trying to solve problems without it will be much
harder but it's also a good opportunity to learn the data structures and algorithms you need to know.

For example: If you're trying to solve a problem that requires you to use a stack, you'll need to know how stacks work
and how to implement them. If you don't know how stacks work, you can look it up on Google or YouTube. Spend some time learning it
and get back to the problem and you'll be able to solve it properly.

## Language of Choice

This is a personal preference, but I recommend using Python as your language of choice. Python is a great language for
solving LeetCode problems because it's easy to read and write. It also has a lot of built-in functions that make it
easier to solve problems. For example, if you need to sort an array, you can use the `sorted()` function. If you need to
reverse a string, you can use the `reversed()` function. If you need to find the length of a string, you can use the
`len()` function. These functions make it easier to solve problems and save you time.

## Solving Problems

### Problem Selection

LeetCode has a large collection of problems, so it can be hard to know where to start. I recommend doing the problems listed at
[https://neetcode.io/](https://neetcode.io/). This is a great site that lists the top LeetCode problems you should solve. If you navigate to
the practice tab, you'll find 4 lists, I recommend doing NeetCode 150. Each problem includes the link to the LeetCode page,
a checkbox so you can keep track of progress, a link to a YouTube video explaining the problem, and a link to the solution.

### Problem Solving Process

When solving a problem, I recommend following this process:

1. Read the problem description and make sure you understand what the problem is asking.
2. Come up with a brute force solution. This is a solution that works but is not very efficient.
3. If you can't come up with anything after a while, it's okay to look at a video explaining the problem.
4. If you end up looking at a video, try to understand the solution and then try to implement it yourself after a day or so.
5. The key here is to be able to solve the problem the next day or so by looking at the problem and coming up with the conceptual solution.

### Problem Types

LeetCode problems can be categorized into a few different types:

-   Array & Hashing
-   Stack
-   Binary Search
-   Linked List
-   Trees
-   Graphs
-   And others...

I recommend solving problems from each of these categories. This will give you a good understanding of the different
types of problems you'll see in interviews. The Neetcode 150 list has a good mix of problems from each category.

## Conclusion

LeetCode is a great platform for practicing coding problems. It has a large collection of problems, ranging from easy to
hard, and supports a variety of programming languages. It also has a built-in IDE that allows you to run your code
against test cases. This guide covered how to use LeetCode effectively to prepare for technical interviews. I hope you
found it helpful and good luck with your interview prep!
