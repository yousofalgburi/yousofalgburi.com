### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. You might have heard about it before, but what does it actually mean?

Let's start with the basics. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't have to specify the type of a variable when you declare it. For example, you can write:

```javascript
let x = 10
```

In this case, `x` is a number. But you can also write:

```javascript
let x = 'hello'
```

In this case, `x` is a string. JavaScript doesn't care about the type of `x`, and it will happily let you assign a number to `x` and then later assign a string to `x`.

This can lead to bugs that are hard to catch. For example, if you write:

```javascript
let x = 10
x.toUpperCase()
```

This code will compile and run without any errors, but it will throw an error at runtime because `x` is a number and `toUpperCase` is a method that only exists on strings.

TypeScript fixes this by adding static types to the language. This means that you can specify the type of a variable when you declare it. For example, you can write:

```typescript
let x: number = 10
```

In this case, `x` is a number, and TypeScript will throw an error if you try to assign a string to `x`:

```typescript
let x: number = 'hello' // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

### Why does TypeScript exist?

JavaScript has been around for 20 years, it started as a scripting language to get browsers to do cool things. It was never designed to be a large scale application language. It was designed to be easy to use and flexible. This is why it has a lot of quirks and oddities.

TypeScript was created to fix these quirks and oddities. It was created to make JavaScript more scalable and maintainable. It was created to make it easier to catch bugs early, improve tooling, enhance collaboration, and scale your codebase.

You might be wondering why TypeScript was created as a superset of JavaScript instead of a completely new language. The reason is that TypeScript was created to be as compatible with JavaScript as possible. This means that you can use existing JavaScript code in TypeScript, and you can gradually migrate your codebase to TypeScript without having to rewrite everything from scratch.

What are some examples of quircky JavaScript behavior that TypeScript fixes?

- **Implicit type coercion**: JavaScript will automatically convert values from one type to another in certain situations. For example, you can write:

```javascript
let x = 10
let y = 'hello'

console.log(x + y) // '10hello'
```

In this case, JavaScript will convert `x` to a string and then concatenate it with `y`. This can lead to bugs that are hard to catch.

TypeScript fixes this by adding static types to the language. This means that you can specify the type of a variable when you declare it. For example, you can write:

```typescript
let x: number = 10
let y: string = 'hello'

console.log(x + y) // Error: Operator '+' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'string'.
```

In this case, TypeScript will throw an error because you're trying to add a number and a string.

- **Implicit global variables**: JavaScript will create a global variable if you forget to use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword when declaring a variable. For example, you can write:

```javascript
function foo() {
	x = 10
}

foo()

console.log(x) // 10
```

In this case, JavaScript will create a global variable called `x` when you assign `10` to `x` inside the `foo` function. This can lead to bugs that are hard to catch.

TypeScript fixes this by adding strict mode to the language. This means that you have to use the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword when declaring a variable. For example, you can write:

```typescript
function foo() {
	x = 10 // Error: Cannot find name 'x'.
}

foo()

console.log(x) // Error: Cannot find name 'x'.
```

In this case, TypeScript will throw an error because you're trying to use `x` without declaring it first.

- **JavaScript equality**: Due to the way JavaScript handles equality, it can be hard to predict the result of comparisons. For example, you can write:

```javascript
console.log(0 == '') // true
console.log(0 == '0') // true
console.log('' == '0') // false
```

In this case, JavaScript will convert the values to the same type before comparing them. This can lead to bugs that are hard to catch.

TypeScript fixes this by not allowing the comparison of variables of different types. For example, you can write:

```typescript
console.log(0 == '') // Error: Operator '==' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'string'.
console.log(0 == '0') // Error: Operator '==' cannot be applied to types 'number' and 'string'.
console.log('' == '0') // Error: Operator '==' cannot be applied to types 'string' and 'string'.
```

In this case, TypeScript will throw an error because you're trying to compare values of different types.

### Why use TypeScript?

Adding static types to JavaScript might seem like a small change, but it has a big impact on the way you write code. Here are a few reasons why you might want to use TypeScript:

- **Catch bugs early**: TypeScript can catch bugs at compile time that would otherwise only be caught at runtime. This can save you a lot of time and effort, especially as your codebase grows.

- **Improve tooling**: TypeScript's static types make it easier for tools like editors and IDEs to understand your code. This can lead to better autocompletion, refactoring, and navigation.

- **Enhance collaboration**: TypeScript's static types make it easier for other developers to understand your code. This can lead to better collaboration and fewer misunderstandings.

- **Scale your codebase**: TypeScript's static types make it easier to scale your codebase. This can lead to better maintainability and fewer bugs as your codebase grows.

### How to get started with TypeScript

If you want to get started with TypeScript, the first thing you'll need to do is install it. You can do this using npm:

```bash
npm install typescript
```

Once you have TypeScript installed, you can start writing TypeScript code by creating files with a `.ts` extension. For example, you can create a file called `hello.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
let x: number = 10

console.log(x)
```

You can then compile this file to JavaScript using the `tsc` command:

```bash

tsc hello.ts
```

This will create a file called `hello.js` with the following content:

```javascript
let x = 10

console.log(x)
```

You can then run this file using Node.js:

```bash

node hello.js
```

This will print `10` to the console.

### What are the best features of TypeScript?

TypeScript has a lot of features that make it a great language to work with. Here are a few of the best features:

- **Inference** - TypeScript can infer the type of a variable based on its value. For example, you can write:

```typescript
let x = 10
```

TypeScript will infer that `x` is a number.

- **Union types** - TypeScript can represent a value that can be one of several types. For example, you can write:

```typescript
let x: number | string = 10

x = 'hello'
```

`x` can be a number or a string.

- **Intersection types** - TypeScript can represent a value that has all the properties of several types. For example, you can write:

```typescript
type A = { a: number }

type B = { b: string }

let x: A & B = { a: 10, b: 'hello' }
```

`x` has all the properties of `A` and `B`.

- **Type guards** - TypeScript can narrow the type of a variable based on a condition. For example, you can write:

```typescript
type A = { a: number }

type B = { b: string }

function foo(x: A | B) {
	if ('a' in x) {
		console.log(x.a)
	} else {
		console.log(x.b)
	}
}
```

TypeScript will narrow the type of `x` to `A` or `B` based on the condition.

- **Type aliases** - TypeScript can create a new name for a type. For example, you can write:

```typescript
type Point = { x: number; y: number }

let p: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 }
```

`Point` is an alias for `{ x: number, y: number }`.

- **Interfaces** - TypeScript can define the shape of an object. For example, you can write:

```typescript
interface Point {
	x: number
	y: number
}

let p: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 }
```

`Point` defines the shape of an object with `x` and `y` properties.

- **Classes** - TypeScript can define a blueprint for creating objects. For example, you can write:

```typescript
class Point {
	constructor(public x: number, public y: number) {}
}

let p = new Point(10, 20)
```

`Point` is a blueprint for creating objects with `x` and `y` properties.

- **Enums** - TypeScript can define a set of named constants. For example, you can write:

```typescript
enum Color {
	Red,
	Green,
	Blue
}

let c: Color = Color.Red
```

- **TypeScript Handbook** - TypeScript has very good documentation. For example, you can read the official TypeScript handbook at [https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).

### Conclusion

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. This can help you catch bugs early, improve tooling, enhance collaboration, and scale your codebase. If you want to get started with TypeScript, you can install it using npm and start writing TypeScript code by creating files with a `.ts` extension.
